      Welcome to the experiment.

      In this task, you will see combinations of images and sounds.

      Specifically, each time, two pictures will appear one after the other. The content of the first picture is always a neutral object. 
      The second picture is either a neutral or an aversive scene. This second picture is accompanied by a matching sound that will be played through the headphones. 

      From now on, we will refer to the first neutral object picture as the cue, and the second picture of a neutral or aversive scene, including the sound, as the outcome.  

      Press SPACE to continue.

      Your task is to use the cue and the outcome to imagine a vivid story in which you yourself play a central role. 
      You should imagine that you perceive the story through your own eyes. 
      When you do this, it is important to form a connection between the two pictures so that when you are given the cue (e.g., a picture of a shoe), 
      you can recall the outcome (e.g., a picture of a bus with the sound of an engine). 
      
      For each cue-outcome pair, it is essential that you spend the entire time vividly imagining your story with the cue-outcome pair, 
      because you will be tested on these pairs immediately after this imagination phase.

      Press SPACE to continue.
    - | 
      In each round, you will get to see 36 cue-outcome pairs. 
      In total there are three rounds, so you will get to see every event three times in total.

      Press SPACE to continue.
    - | 
      In the third and final round, you will be asked to rate to what extent you feel like you have succeeded in
      creating a coherent story with the cue-outcome pairs. With the coherence scale we ask you to rate to what extent you
      feel you managed to mentally link the pictures and the sound into one single story. This scale ranges from
      not at all coherent to very coherent.

      Press SPACE to continue   
    - |  
      To answer the coherence scale, you should press and hold the left mouse button while moving to the left or right.
      Once you let go of the mouse, that is your answer. 

      You have 4 seconds to submit your rating, you should submit your answer within these 4 seconds. 
      This is not very long, so don't overthink your answer and go with your gut feeling.

      There are no right or wrong answers, just try to assess your answers as honestly as possible.

      Press SPACE to continue.

      You will start with two practice trials.
      If you have any questions after the practice, please let the experimenter know

      We will start with calibrating the eye-tracker.

      Press SPACE to continue, then follow the instructions of the experimenter.

      Welcome back.

      We will start with calibrating the eye-tracker again. Please follow the instructions.

      Press SPACE to continue.
  Start instructions:
    - |
      Today you will be shown the same cue-outcome pairs as yesterday.
      You should continue imagining vivid stories with these images and sounds. Always from the first person perspective
      Some outcomes may not be shown. Please update your stories accordingly.

      Press SPACE to continue.
    - |
      Today there will be four rounds. In the last round, there will again be a coherence scale for you to rate how coherent your story was.

      There will be no practice block today. The task will start straight away. 
      If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter now.

      If you are ready, press SPACE to start the task.

      Welcome back.
      This is the final session.

      We will start with calibrating the eye-tracker again. Please follow the instructions.

      Press SPACE to continue.

  Start instructions:
    - | 
      Today you will once again see cue-outcome pairs. Please pay close attention.

      You do not have to fill out any rating scales.

      The task will start straight away. Please let the experimenter know if you have any questions.
